""":mod:`finagg` configuration and global SQLAlchemy setup. Backend file paths
and SQLAlchemy engine database URLs are configured in this module at runtime
according to environment variables.

Environment variables should ideally be configured using an ``.env`` file
in the desired working directory. Running ``finagg install`` will
automaticaly setup the ``.env`` file for you according to your input values.
Environment variables assigned in the ``.env`` file are loaded on the
:mod:`finagg` module's first instantiation.
